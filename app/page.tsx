        Hi, I'm Oliver Ramirez, a senior Computer Science student at Colorado College with a
        deep passion for software engineering.  My experience spans technologies including
        Python, Java, React, Github, SQL, C, and more. Since beginning my undergraduate
        studies at Colorado College in 2022 I have been pursuing a career in software engineering
        by working internships with Charles Schwab and Jacobs Technology while also doing research
        alongside professors at Aquincum Institute of Technology in Budapest, Hungary. I am excited
        to share my experiences and projects with you!
